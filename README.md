# I have edited this entire file

The intended and somewhat successful purpose for this repo was to practice writting code. Very new to Python and programing all together,
I gave my first attempt at a game. I had fun, learned so much, and most valuable I sat down and actually worked out the code for several hours
for several days, good pure stat boosting my brain. So much time was spent reading, searching things about my code, very basic.
Only a couple functions, some variables and definitions, not many lines in general, more like the same txt several times. Having several things/parts work, displaying
structure at a foundational level for the first time was great experience. 

Also Tkinter GUI stuff was uploaded. When I mentioned not having many lines of code to edit, fix and figure out, I was refering to Tkinter. It does seem
to be a good tool, I did learn some things with the package. Tkinter is very cool and ujseful, it is puit together well in that when creating a GUI
the code will be so readable it is crazy. This is nice however I believe causes people to think it is easier to learn and use than it is. A Begginer
should not be wriotting a GUI with Tkinter right away after some simple scipts. Learning alone, spending time constatly trying to learn more, this 
actyually may have caused more confusion than almost any other module. When you can code and put togther a program and feel good doing it, things
are understood or even common knowledge when your able to code. I truly think, scripts posted everywhere to with info to help learn caused confusion
especially when 100s have been looked at, studied and not one comment on why things were coded the way they are. That sounds weird and maybe abstract, 
but it is the absolute most basic thing being skipped over in every learning tool I used, and I used many, even Couresa, books ect. The thing is
Tkinter always is written a certain way, and the problem is there are 3 of these certain ways. Learning you don't even realize one Tkinter script is
formatted differently, making the code not even close at all. Once I discovered things from one tutorial could only be used or tried to be used
with code from similar styled scripts. Not just copy pasting, I do mean rules and general python logic. 

Some, perhaps most will be the same script with some edits and additional code. This was to save progress everyday, more of a personal coding journal,
rather than functional package. You can definatley run the game, PyGame will be needed, also you may get the sprites I used or even use your own.
You must have files named the same as the sprites names I posted, with Python able to find them.
