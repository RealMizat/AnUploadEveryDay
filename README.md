# AnUploadEveryDay
To challenege myself I am going to be trying to upload some kind of code everyday. This is to help myself actually code more when studying and researching. I do everyday but find myself reading much more than typing, witch doesn't get you far, at least in any reasonable amount of time. This will help me and others if you would like, to upload more, and possibly pay more attention to how I am coding, although I will admit I haven't thought much about the readability and comments as much as just learning fundamentals.

Edit - While working on a simple game I updated the same file(s) several times. So a new file wasn't created for each and every day. However some versions, or steps in the process are uploaded.

It's hard to tell when things were uploaded, because if something was uploaded at 5 am and the previous night at midnight, they will say x days ago, so it doesn't show the daily uploads perfectly, witch is fine. I do think a file system will need to be added as well as how I name the files. Maybe a file a month, I don't want to do project because I don't plan on uploading the same projects and edits all the time, that kind of just happened with the Pygame "game".

You are welcome to use any code, please give credit if used in anyway that others may see the program/code. I may put license on certain things and they may differ. I will try to put a comment on the top of things that are under an open source license, and then perhaps edit this (witch I will do anyways) or other files with the license and links.

Let me know if you want to upload something everyday to challenge yourself, I invite everyone from all languages and skill levels, and would be glad to make a project, then perhaps folders for months, and sub folders with each day for people to upload to, if another person is interested.

Also currently having to take care of some imortant things witch is holding me back from coding/learning/pracricing. I would love to try and get into the go langage when it is all taken care of or blown over or things just get better. Also have been very interested in memory alocation, and rom hacks, and basically just changing any source code the hard way, with few tools avaible. Would like to get into the homebrew sceen for the Wii, or 3DS also. However would need to learn more C, Cpython is a thing idk how far it would take me.
