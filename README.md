# AnUploadEveryDay
To challenege myself I am going to be trying to upload some kind of code everyday. This is to help myself actually code more when studying and researching. I do everyday but find myself reading much more than typing, witch doesn't get you far, at least in any reasonable amount of time. This will help me and others if you would like, to upload more, and possibly pay more attention to how I am coding, although I will admit I haven't thought much about the readability and comments as much as just learning fundamentals.

This was a challenge I had for myself. It turned into most uploads being progress on a simple game I created. This was just for myself to practice and submit something "functional" or a "fix" or progress. I may come back to the game in the future, or start a new, with a new repo so if anyone wants to see it, the code will not be a jumbled mess like this repo.
