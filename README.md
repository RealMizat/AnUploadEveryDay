# I have edited this entire file

The intended and somewhat successful purpose for this repo was to practice writting code. Very new to Python and programing all together,
I gave my first attempt at a game. I had fun, learned so much, and most valuable I sat down and actually worked out the code for several hours
for several days, good pure stat boosting my brain. So much time was spent reading, searching things about my code, very basic.
Only a couple functions, some variables and definitions, not many lines in general, more like the same txt several times. Having several things/parts work, displaying
structure at a foundational level for the first time was great experience. 

Some, perhaps most will be the same script with some edits and additional code. This was to save progress everyday, more of a personal coding journal,
rather than functional package. You can definatley run the game, PyGame will be needed, also you may get the sprites I used or even use your own.
You must have files named the same as the sprites names I posted, with Python able to find them.
